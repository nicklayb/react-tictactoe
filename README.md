# TicTacToe

This is a TicTacToe game using React Hooks, Context Provider and currying.

## Learning purposes

Nothing is complicated there as you can see, but I wanted to experiment logic and ui decoupling using Hooks and Context Provider and it turns out to be a real success. These two helps reducing the occurences of side effects and helps state to be immutable which make the app way more understandable.

Feel free to try and see how things were built and don't hesitate to poke me (@_nboisvert)[https://twitter.com/_nboisvert] if you have any question on why any decision were made that way.

## Use of currying

After learning Elm and Haskell I realized how currying can help reducing code repition. That said, I think this would be prefered on TypeScript since you may get lost on how and when things are curried.
